                <h3>Tiramisu (italy)</h3></h3>
                <p>Tiramisu is an Italian dessert made of ladyfinger pastries dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of egg yolks, sugar, and mascarpone, and flavoured with cocoa powder. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts.
</p><h3>Ingridients</h3>
<p>Dutch Processed Cocoa Powder</p>
<p>Espresso - you'll need a cup, so brew a handful of shots or buy them pre-brewed from your favorite coffee shop or grocery store
<p>Vanilla Extract</p>
<p>Pasteurized Eggs - I always buy pasteurized eggs for this recipe as that means the eggs have been heat treated to kill off bacteria that could potentially cause a food borne illness. And since we're using raw eggs, it's the way to go!
<p>Sugar</p>
<p>Kosher Salt</p>
<p>Mascarpone Cheesve - an integral part!! There isn't a great substitution here.</p>
<p>Heavy cream</p>
<p>Ladyfinger Cookies </p>

                <h3>Tonkatsu (japan)</h3></h3>
                <p>Tonkatsu, a Japanese delicacy made of a breaded and deep-fried pork cutlet, originated in the early twentieth century. Slices of pork are coated in panko and then fried in oil.
                </p><h3>Ingridients</h3>
                <p>Boneless pork loin or pork chop - I used two slices of boneless pork loin pounded to ¾ inch thick. I prefer the pork to be on the thicker side as it results in juicier tonkatsu.
<p>Flour - Use all-purpose flour to coat the pork chops so the egg and panko coating stick to the pork.
<p>Egg - The egg helps bind the bread crumbs to the pork, creating a crispy crust.
